# ClickUp Integration Testing Guide

## Prerequisites

1. **Environment Setup**: Make sure your `.env` file includes:
   ```
   CLICKUP_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   CLICKUP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   CLICKUP_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/clickup/callback
   ```

2. **ClickUp App Configuration**: 
   - Go to ClickUp Settings > Apps
   - Create a new app or verify existing app
   - Set redirect URI to: `http://localhost:3000/auth/clickup/callback`

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

### 2. Login with Google
- Visit http://localhost:3000
- Click "Login with Google"
- Complete Google OAuth flow

### 3. Connect ClickUp
- After Google login, you should see the ClickUp Integration section
- Click "ðŸ”— Connect ClickUp" button
- You'll be redirected to ClickUp for authorization
- Grant permissions to the app
- You'll be redirected back with success message

### 4. Configure ClickUp Workspace
- After successful ClickUp authentication, you'll see workspace selection
- Choose your desired Team > Space > List from the dropdown
- Click "âœ… Configure Default List"
- You should see confirmation message

### 5. Test Email Processing
- Click "ðŸ“§ Fetch Latest 5 Emails"
- For any email, click "ðŸš€ Create Task from Email"
- The Chipp.ai response should now include:
  - ClickUp access token in the system prompt
  - Default list ID for task creation
  - Instructions for Chipp to create actual ClickUp tasks

### 6. Verify ClickUp Task Creation
- Check your ClickUp workspace
- Look for newly created tasks in the configured list
- Tasks should include:
  - Email subject as task title
  - Email content in description
  - Appropriate priority level
  - Due dates (if mentioned in email)

## Expected Behavior

### Without ClickUp Configuration
- Chipp provides task suggestions only
- No actual ClickUp tasks are created
- Response format: "ðŸ“‹ **Suggested Task:** ..."

### With ClickUp Configuration
- Chipp creates actual ClickUp tasks via API
- Response includes ClickUp task links
- Response format: "âœ… Task created successfully! ðŸ”— **ClickUp Link:** ..."

## Troubleshooting

### ClickUp Authentication Fails
- Check ClickUp app credentials in `.env`
- Verify redirect URI matches exactly
- Check ClickUp app permissions

### No Workspaces/Lists Found
- Ensure ClickUp user has access to workspaces
- Check ClickUp API permissions
- Verify access token is valid

### Task Creation Fails
- Check ClickUp list permissions
- Verify list ID is correct
- Check Chipp.ai API integration

## API Endpoints

- `GET /clickup/auth` - Start ClickUp OAuth
- `GET /clickup/callback` - Handle OAuth callback
- `GET /clickup/workspaces` - Get user workspaces/lists
- `POST /clickup/configure` - Save default list configuration
- `GET /clickup/status` - Get current ClickUp status

## Success Indicators

âœ… ClickUp authentication successful
âœ… Workspaces and lists loaded
âœ… Default list configured
âœ… Email processing includes ClickUp credentials
âœ… Chipp creates actual ClickUp tasks
âœ… Task links returned in response
